          Have a child who is over the age of 18 and he/she thinks they are now an adult?<br><br>

          You have done a fantastic job bringing up your child. You have sacrificed your entire life to ensure that your child has had a wonderful education.
          <br><br>
          Are you worried about their future?<br>
          Stressed that your child is not doing something useful with that education?<br>
          Frustrated hearing statements like “I am still young and am trying to figure things out” …<br>
          <br><br>
          You are not alone! No child at that age wants to get told what to do by their parents.<br><br>
          
          If your child is in college or in their twenties, they will be tired of the constant pressure. Be it in a job interview or at a social get together they’re constantly asked about their future plans by everyone they meet in one form or another. They maybe a little confused with so many options available to them.
          <br><br>
          You know your child the best. You clearly know what they are good at and they struggle at. But your child is yet to make up their mind on what they want in life. Most of the important decisions in their life were taken by YOU. They have never had complete independence in taking their decisions. 
          <br><br>
          Don’t you think, if your son or daughter gets the right direction and the right time your dream of seeing them doing better than you will be fulfilled.
          <br><br>

We are here to listen, be authentic in our feedback, and share our experience in a manner that propels them to discover and accomplish their Vision.
