        <button class="accordion">Why UBU?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>We at UBU believe that every young adult can lead a fulfilled life. This can be accomplished when you process your dreams into your Synchronous Vision. As Vision Coaches we will be focusing on your dreams related to all aspects of your life which include Career, Health, Family, Making a Difference (by helping others) etc.
            <br><br>We make it very easy for you to process your dreams into your Vision.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">I'm doing well already, do I still need a Vision coach? </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>We are very happy to see young adults who are doing well in life. We hope that you have a Synchronous Vision which encompasses your career aspirations, health and fitness goals, great family and making a difference in the world.
            <br><br>If you think that you are doing really well in all of these aspects, then you might not need a Vision Coach. If you think that you want to develop a Synchronous Vision, then you can try Vision Coaching.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Does UBU help me only on the path of achieving financial goals?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Financial goals are important in life and we have a session which deals with financial planning. We at UBU strongly believe that it is something every young adult has to learn. But life is more than just money and finances. Money can’t buy health or a good family.
            <br><br>We can help you with your goals irrespective of whether they are related to your finances, health, family, serving society or anything else which is important for you in life.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">I have more than one goal, will UBU help me achieve all of them?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>We are always excited to interact with young adults like you who have multiple goals in life. We can help you in prioritising them based on your own unique personality, perspective, circumstances etc. This will help you in achieving all your goals in a systematic manner.
          </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">I'm 60+, do I still need a vision coach?        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Dreams don’t have an expiry date. If you have dreams and want to process them into a Vision, a Vision coach can help you. Age is just a number. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">I have young children, will they benefit from UBU?         </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Anyone can benefit from UBU. It depends on how keen they are to take charge of their life.          </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Can my dream be vague?         </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Ofcourse. All Visions start off as a vague dream. If you are keen to process your dreams into your Vision, we can make it very easy for you.          </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">I have big goals and no money to invest, how do I make it?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Ambani started off as a petrol attendant. Rajnikanth was a bus conductor, Patricia Narayan who used to sell homemade pickles, jams and squashes owns a chain of restaurants in Chennai, Narendra Modi started off as a Chaiwala.
            <br><br>Everyone is blessed with different skills and resources. If you have big dreams and want to achieve them, we can support you to convert your dreams into your Vision.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">How is Vision Coaching different from Career Coaching?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Career Coaching focuses only on your career. As Vision Coaches we will be focusing on all your dreams which include Career, Health, Family, Making a Difference (by helping others) etc.
            <br><br>Career is very important, but it is just one part of your life and you need to work on all your dreams to live more fulfilled lives.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">How does Vision Coaching benefit me?        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>You are constantly busy. It is very hard for you to stop and consider your future, and where you want to be. The very idea of long-term planning is very overwhelming.
            <br><br>We have created a simple and efficient process for you to process your dreams into your Vision.
            <br><br>As Vision coaches, we ensure that you focus exactly on what you want, help you identify all options available to you (including a few that you may not have thought of yourself) and then break it down for you to achieve it faster.
            <br><br>We are dedicated 100% to you and your future.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">What sorts of people have a Vision Coach?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>If you have a desire to create a wonderful future for yourself where you can lead a happier and more fulfilled life and realize that you will stay focused and get there quicker with the support of a coach or a mentor, you will benefit tremendously by having a Vision Coach.
            <br><br>From our experience people from all walks of life benefit from Vision coaching. We have coached people of all ages from preschoolers to senior citizens. The only trait all these people have in common is their desire to create a wonderful future by being more open to change.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">How long are the coaching sessions?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Each Vision Coaching session takes approximately 45-60 minutes. We ideally suggest that the sessions are done without too much of a gap between each other since the learnings from each lead to the next session. We are flexible and the sessions can be daily, few times a week or even once in a week depending on your schedule and the speed at which you want to proceed on your journey.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">How many Vision Coaching sessions will I need?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>The 5 broad steps in your UBU journey are<ol>
            <li>   UBU Preview</li> 
            <li>    UBU Insight</li> 
              <li>    UBU Breakthrough</li> 
                <li>    UBU Experience</li> 
                  <li>    UBU Blueprint</li> </ol>
            <p>Each step has a specific objective towards arriving at your Vision. For some people the whole UBU journey may take as little as 7 sessions and for some others it will be more. It varies from person to person based on the individual’s dreams.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Where does the coaching take place?        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>The coaching is designed to take place online. This has proven to be the most convenient way for young adults like you to fit coaching into your busy lives. We suggest that you find a quiet room with no distractions where you can totally focus on the conversation.
            <br><br>Face to face coaching is also available for young adults in Bangalore if they prefer this option.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">What will I have to do?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>To get the best from the Vision Coaching, you will need to have a positive attitude towards the achievement of your goals. The more open, trusting and honest you are with the coaches, the better will be the results for you. You need to have the time and commitment to think about the learning from each session and complete the tasks that will help you get the most from your next session.
          <br><br>Ultimately your level of commitment will directly influence the speed and extent to which your Vision will be realised. We are there to provide you with boundless motivation, support and encouragement within a confidential and non-judgemental environment.
